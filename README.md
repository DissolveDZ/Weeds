# Weeds
## A farming game made with the Raylib framework and C! <br>

### Weeds have attacked your farm, making it hard to sustain it, <br> by upgrading your farm might manage to survive!

### WASD/Arrow keys/Mouse to move. <br>
### Click or Enter to plant. <br>
### TAB to open the upgrade menu. <br>
I'm sorry i used raylib, might be porting this to my own 2D engine soon <br> 
I do NOT own any of the music/sounds used, nor am I profiting from this project <br> 
The music is called "Return Trip" and is an OST for the nintendo "engine" called Smile Basic.
